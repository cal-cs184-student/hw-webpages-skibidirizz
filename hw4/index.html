		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<p>We took some screenshots of the simulation after it had reached "equilibrium", or when the cloth stopped moving much.</p>
		<p>Here, we changed the values of k = [500, 5000, 50000] with density = 15 as a constant.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; align-items: center; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; padding: 20px;">

			</div>
			
		</div>
		<p>As k increases, we can see the cloth look more and more just the flat cloth grid unaffected by external forces in Part 1. This is because when k increases the force of the springs starts to outweigh the forces from the external forces on each point mass, causing the cloth to look more and more uniform. This is much different than the default parameters since the cloth becomes much stiffer at k=1000.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Here, we changed values of d = [1, 10, 100, 1000] while keeping k = 5000 constant.</p>

			  </div>
		</div>
		<p>As density increases, we can see the cloth start to sag more and more. This is due to the point masses weighing a lot more now - and when density = 1000, you can see a triangle start to form as the cloth starts to really weigh down on the 2 pinned point masses. This is much different from the default parameters as the cloth sags a lot when density=1000</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Here, we set k = 5000 and d = 15, while changing damping between [0, 1.00%]. To see the effects of damping, we no longer wait till the cloth achieves "equilibrium", and instead take a picture after 2 seconds of the simulation have passed.</p>

		<p>It is a little difficult to tell here, but increasing dampening makes the cloth fall at a quicker speed, and it falls at a uniform pace as well. This makes sense - when dampening = 0, we have no energy lost to friction or heat, so we don't expect any of the force to decrease as the cloth falls. When dampening increases, the cloth loses more and more energy to heat and friction, thus our cloth falls a lot more slowly and it decelerates much faster too. This is much different from the default parameters since the cloth falls a lot slower when damp=1.00%</p>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>
			For sphere and plane collision, our algorithms followed these general steps, for a given point mass and object:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Determine whether the point mass intersects with the object. Return if it does not.</li>
			<li>Find the tangent point on the surface of the object, with the given point mass's position.</li>
			<li>Compute the correction vector from the point mass's old position to this tangent point: \[correction\_vector = tangent\_point - last\_position\] We need to compute this correction vector explicitly because the tangent point is not (necessarily) on the line from the point mass’s old position to its current/new position. </li>
			<li>Set the point mass's new position to the following equation, where friction is a property of the object:
				\[position = last\_position + correction\_vector * (1 - friction)\]
				The <code>(1-friction)</code> factor essentially scales down the correction vector to find a middle point between the old position and the tangent point– a reasonable location for the new position to be.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The last two steps are the same for both sphere and plane collision, but the first two look differ in their implementation.
		</p>
		<p>
			For sphere collision, checking if our point mass collided with the sphere was simple.
			All we needed to do was check if its position’s distance from the sphere’s origin was smaller than the sphere’s radius or not.
			If it were smaller, than meant we collided.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tangent point was defined as the point where the line from origin to point mass's position intersected the sphere's surface.
			This point can be computed with the following equation: \[tangent\_point = origin + (radius * (position - origin).unit())\]
		</p>
		<p>
			For plane collision, we used dot product to check if the point mass intersected the plane.
			We first defined two vectors: one between the plane point and the point mass's old position, and the other between the plane point and the point mass's new position.
			With each of these vectors, we computed its dot product with the plane’s normal vector.
			The sign of these dot products tells us which side of the plane the old and new positions are on.
			As such, if the dot products had opposite signs, the point mass intersected the plane.
		</p>
		<p>
			To compute the tangent point / point of collision, we use the ray-plane intersection algorithm from class, with the ray being represented by the vector from the point mass's old position to plane point.
			This gives us a point directly on the plane.
			Since we want a point that is slightly above the plane, we also offset this tangent point by a <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code> in the direction of the normal vector.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout both collision algorithms, we take care to make sure vector directions align and give us our intended result.
		</p>

		</div>
		<p>
			The main difference here is that as ks increases, the "stiffness" of the cloth increases.
			At <code>k = 500</code>, we can see the cloth draped on the sphere has lots of surface area where the cloth is directly contacting the sphere.
			This is because the force of gravity is stronger than the internal forces of the springs.
			As <code>k</code> increases, we can see in the picture where <code>k = 50000</code> that much less of the cloth is actually contacting the sphere.
			This is because the high force incurred by the springs is making the cloth more stiff, and thus it doesn't drape over the sphere as much.
		</p>
		<p>Here, we see how our cloth collides with a plane:</p>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>
			Our implementation follows the task description very closely.
		</p>
		<p>
			For <code>hash_position()</code>, We use the given equations of <code>w</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>t</code> to define our 3D boxes.
			Then, instead of using <code>fmod</code> to find which box a point mass belongs in, we simply divide its positions's 
			<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> coordinates by <code>w</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>t</code> respectively and floor the results, to get our 3D box's indices: <code>wi</code>, <code>hi</code>, and <code>ti</code>.
			Then, with these indices, we use the classic nested array index to 1D array index translation to get a unique box ID: \[hash = wi + hi * width + ti * width * height\] 
		</p>
		<p>
			The final hash / unique box ID is this integer casted to a float.
		</p>
		<p>
			For <code>build_spatial_map()</code>, we first clear the cloth's <code>map</code> to get rid of the last time step's data.
			Then, we iterate through all the cloth's point masses, compute its hash by calling <code>hash_position()</code> on it, and add it to the <code>map</code>, taking care to create a new key-value pair in the <code>map</code> if its hash did not already exist.
			We also make sure to allocate the list of point masses with that hash (the value in the key-value pair) in the heap, so that other functions will have access to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			For <code>self_collide()</code>, we iterate through all candidate point masses to determine if the given point mass collides with it.
			These candidates are all other point masses in the same box as the given point mass, retrieved from our <code>map</code>.
			Before iterating through candidates, we initialize a <code>correction_vector</code> to the zero vector in 3D, and a count of collided point masses to 0.
			On each iteration, we first check if the candidate is the given point mass itself by address, continue to the next iteration if they share the same address.
			Then, we check if the distance between point mass and candidate is below the given threshold <code>(2 * thickness)</code>.
			If so, then we say the points collided, and compute this individual correction vector with the following equation:
			\[correction\_vector = \frac{threshold - ||v||}{||v||} * v \:\: \text{where} \:\: v =  position - candidate\_position \] 
			This essentially is the vector that our point mass needs to be shifted by, in order to be a valid distance away from the candidate point mass.
			This correction vector is then added to our accumulated correction vector that we initialized prior to iteration.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the iteration, we divide the accumulated correction vector by the number of collisions to get the average, as intended. Then, we divide it again by <code>simulation_steps</code>. This final, averaged and scaled collision vector is added to our point mass’s position to get its final, non-self-collided position.
		</p>
		<p>
			We bringing these 3 functions together in <code>simulate()</code>.
			We first populate our box-to-point-masses mapping by calling <code>build_spatial_map()</code>, which calls <code>hash_position()</code> internally.
			Then, we iterate through all point masses in the cloth, and call <code>self_collide()</code> on each,
			using this map to compute collisions with the cloth itself and adjust each point mass's position accordingly.

		<p>As density increases, the amount of folds on the cloth increases. When the cloth is heavier, you expect the force of gravity to outweigh the stiffness of the cloth stored by its spring forces, which is why there are so many folds. At a lower density, the spring forces hold up more against gravity, causing less folds to occur.</p>

		</div>
		<p>As ks increases, the amount of folds on the cloth decreases. This makes sense - as outlined earlier, higher k values make the cloth more stiff and resistant to folding from the forces of gravity, so less folds as ks increases makes sense.</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>Shader Programs</h3>
		<p>
			A shader program is essentially code that helps you shade in your graphic as it is being rendered on your screen (i.e. during the rendering pipeline).
			These programs run on GPU and are specifically meant for graphics, so they are much faster at rendering your graphics than, say, a piece of software made with typical software coding languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			A single program is comprised of a vertex shader, followed by a fragment shader.
			The vertex shader handles everything pertaining to vertices, getting all values needed about these vertices for rendering purposes, and that the fragment shader needs. We can think of this as "per vertex."
			The fragment shader takes this information about given vertices, and fills in the missing spaces in between them, in order to render pixels properly– considering texture, color, shadows, lighting, etc. We can think of this as "per pixel."
		</p>
		<p>
			Between the two shaders, vertices and points are translated between different coordinate spaces, which enable us to go from some 3D object in world space, and translate it into a 2D screen.
			More specifically, the vertex shader takes model-space values and outputs world-space values that the fragment shader takes as input.
		</p>
		<p>
			The shader program, all in all, shades in your graphic properly, with high efficiency.
		</p>
		<h3>Blinn-Phong Shading Model</h3>
		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model is one method of shading in your scene given the light sources and objects you have in your scene.
			It splits your light into 3 different categories: ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ambient light is like a constant base source of light in our scene.
			This is the model's way if defining and setting each object's color in the scene.
			There may not be a direct light source on some point on an object, but that does not mean that point should be black.
			This is where ambient light comes in and makes sure your object has some color on it.
			Diffuse light represents light that comes in from a specific direction, hits your surface at a given point, and scatters uniformly from there.
			It is mainly for parts that generally receive a decent amount of light, but not for the bright highlights on your object.
			Specular reflection handles those really bright parts of your object.
			With specular reflection, we can set a value <code>p</code> in its equation for light to determine how intense we want this type of lighting to be.
			The result is that this <code>p</code> value is like a measure of how shiny we want the surface to be.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model takes these three types of light and sums their values for each point, in order to obtain a final image.
		</p>
		<p>Here, we have a screenshot of our Blinn-Phong shading model only outputting the ambient component,
			a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component,
			a screen shot only outputting the specular component,
			and one putting this all together into the entire Blinn-Phong model.
