		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method used to evaluate and construct Bezier curves. It takes n points, and constructs a curve that passes through the first and last of these n points, using the intermediate ones to influence the shape of the curve.</p>
		<p>At each step of De Casteljau's algorithm, we take some n points and output n-1 new points. The algorithm iterates through the original points. On each iteration i, it uses linear interpolation with some parameter t to find a new point between the ith and (i+1)th point. The parameter t is the same for all parts of this algorithm. After going through all original n points, the algorithm has calculated (n-1) new ones. This is a single step in the recursive algorithm.</p>
		<p>We repeat this recursive step until we output just 1 point. This final point lies on the Bezier curve t, and all other points that the algorithm used and calculated help define the shape of the curve t.</p>
		<p>Here is an example of the entire De Casteljau's algorithm.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<li><b>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</b></li>
		<br/>
		The Casteljau algorithm can extend to Bezier surfaces because Bezier surfaces can just be represented as a collection of 3D control points. In order to 
		evaluate the Bezier surface, we can generate n 3D Bezier curves -- one for each row. Once we have n of these 3D Bezier curves, we can recursively call 
		evaluateStep() on these until they converge on a single point - we will then use these n points to run our algorithm one final time to get a Bezier surface.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<li><b>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
		</b></li>
		<br/>
		<li>To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we need to calculate 1 vector normal to the face
		for every face incident to our vertex. For example, if our vertex was incident to
		6 faces, we'd need to calculate 6 normal vectors, 1 for each face, and then sum them up
		and return the unit vector of this sum.</li>
		<li>In order to traverse through all the incident faces,
		we used the algorithm described in lecture and the primer where you keep iterating through
		h->next()->twin(), and get the corresponding face from h->face(). We can compute 2 vectors along
		the face by just using 2 arbitrary face edges as these vectors, and then we compute the cross to get 
		our normal vector.
		</li>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<li><b>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
		</b></li>
		<br/>
		Implementing edge flip was fairly straightforward - we just drew the before and after of
		our edge flip and referenced our solution with the link provided on how to correctly flip an edge. Once
		we knew our diagram was correct, we tediously reassigned a bunch of pointers, including ones that didn't change.
		One minor mistake we made along the way was assignined the outside half-edge pointers to incorrect variables,
		when we should have just set outside_halfedge->next() = outside_halfedge->next() for consistency!

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<li><b>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</b></li>
		<br/>
		To be entirely honest this part was pretty much as straightforward as part 4, just a very tedious
		drawing out of the expected before and after, initializing the new items as part of the mesh,
		and then very carefully reassigning all of the pointers for every single data structure. We didn't really
		struggle nearly as much as last time, since this operation is just very detail oriented but not 
		highly complex. The only thing we had to debug was a circular Halfedge linked list which caused our code to crash,
		but we quickly identified the mistake.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>
			To implement the loop subdivision, we first computed the new positions of old vertices, since this calculation doesn't depend on the new vertices, and it's much easier to find neighboring old vertices prior to adding the new ones.
			We also made sure to flag these vertices as old, for the sake of the flipping part of the algorithm later.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, for each edge, we computed the positions of the new vertices that would split the edge in half in the splitting part of the algorithm. We stored them in the newPosition attribute of the edge, to use for later.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, we did the actual splitting. Outside of just calling <code>splitEdge</code> on all old edges, there were a few interesting implementation points to consider.
		</p>
		<p>
			First of all, we could not just iterate through the edges beginning to end of the mesh (using <code>for (EdgeIter e = mesh.edgesBegin(); e != mesh.edgesEnd(); e++)</code>), since we would be adding new edges and vertices along the way.
			We considered using the <code>isNew</code> flag to differentiate old and new edges here to resolve this issue. However, this would require us to set the <code>isNew</code> flag of the two new edges that split the original edge to <code>true</code>.
			While that may make sense, we had to use this <code>isNew</code> flag to differentiate completely new edges, as opposed to an old edge split into two new edges, later on for the flipping part of the algorithm.
			As such, once an edge is split, the two new edges, that replace where the old edge was, still have their <code>isNew</code> attribute set to <code>false</code>.
			And the two new edges that actually split the original triangle have their <code>isNew</code> attribute set to <code>true</code>.
			Since this approach didn't work, we put all the original edges in a separate list, and iterated through that list to split, instead of directly iterating via the mesh iterator when splitting.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another interesting detail there is that the implementation of <code>splitEdge</code> actually mattered, in determining whether our new vertex pointed to a new Halfedge or an old Halfedge. This determined what is set to true and what is set to false in the following code block:
		</p>
		<div style="text-align: center;">
			<img src="6.1-code-edges.png" width="350px"/>
		</div>
		<p>
			After splitting, we implemented the flipping portion. This part was straightforward with the algorithm. However, we originally thought that we would have to do the same thing as in splitting with creating a separate list of all edges to iterate through, since we were changing the composition of the edges.
			However, we tried direct use of the mesh iterator, which surprisingly gave the same output. We realized that the iterator doesn't use the properties of the edges to iterate through all of them, so changing those properties doesn't effect the iterator; only adding and deleting edges would affect it.
		</p>
		<p>Finally, officially setting the new position of all vertices was straightforward, with iterating through all vertices. That concludes the whole algorithm.</p>
		<p>Debugging was a matter of trying different code and seeing if it worked, such as with and without extracting a list of edges prior to splitting and flipping. Visualizing each change, with half edges and twins and nexts and vertices, on a piece of paper, also helped with working with setting <code>isNew</code> correctly on necessary edges.
			Thankfully, our part 4 and part 5 implementation of splitting and flipping were already fully correct and required no extra debugging to fix.
			Of course, putting local functions in a larger algorithm can complicate things. Another debugging trick we used was to manually split via hotkey 'S' a certain triangle, and see if the split from upsampling was the same. This required figuring out the order in which a given triangle's edges were being split, but we used simple if conditions and print statements to figure that out.
